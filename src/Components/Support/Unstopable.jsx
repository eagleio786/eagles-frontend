      <p>
        The entire concept of The Eagles is based on infinitely working
        independent programs, where no one, not even the creators, has any
        control over their operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The smart contract makes their logic immutable, meaning it cannot be
        changed or destroyed as it is stored on the blockchain. The combination
        of economically sound programs and the immutability of the smart
        contract makes The Eagles unstoppable.
      </p>
      <p>
        No authorities, hackers, or even the founders can interfere or make any
        changes. The Eagles will operate as long as the Internet exists.{' '}
