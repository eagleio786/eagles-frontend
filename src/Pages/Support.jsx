            The Eagles has no owners or management. It has been deployed as a
            smart contract and from that moment runs independently. No one can
            tamper with it, even the founders and developers, since smart
            contracts are irreversible by nature.

            The Eagles has no access to the funds, and nothing can affect the

            subject to market fluctuations.
