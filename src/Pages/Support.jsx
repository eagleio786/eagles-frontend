          </h1>
          <h2 className='text-xl font-bold'>• 100% Decentralized</h2>
          <p>
            {' '}
            The Eagles has no owners or management. It has been deployed as a
            smart contract and from that moment runs independently. No one can
            tamper with it, even the founders and developers, since smart
            contracts are irreversible by nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Eagles smart contract regulates the interactions between the
            users according to the marketing programs.

          <p>
            There is no CEO or owner who can change the rules and terms of The
            Eagles ecosystem. The founders are ordinary users who follow the
            same rules and mechanics as everyone else in the community.

            All transactions are executed peer-to-peer, from one personal wallet
            to another. The platform itself does not store any funds. There is
            no need to ‘withdraw,’ since there’s nothing to withdraw. The funds
            are already on the users’ wallets.
          </p>
          <p>
            {' '}
            The Eagles has no access to the funds, and nothing can affect the
            crypto economics of the smart contract.

            Even if the website crashes or becomes blocked, it won’t stop The
            Eagles from operating. The website is merely an interface that
            facilitates the interaction between users. All the transactions are
            made on the blockchain, and they can never be compromised or
            canceled.

            The basic principles of interaction between users, as well as the
            cryptoeconomics in all The Eagles blockchain, are similar. However,
            The Eagles USDT allows users to earn a stable income in USDT
            stablecoin, which is pegged to the US dollar and is therefore not
            subject to market fluctuations.

            The Eagles founders are treated like ordinary participants. They
